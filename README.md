Hi, I’m Akshaya, an Associate Professor of Epidemiology working at the intersection of population health, digital data, and applied AI.
My work focuses on turning messy, large-scale digital signals into policy-relevant public health evidence - with an emphasis on spatial access, health misinformation, pharmacoepidemiology, and real-world surveillance.
This GitHub hosts fully reproducible research code, methodological prototypes, and visualization tools used in academic publications, grant proposals, and public-facing dashboards.

**Research Focus**
1. Digital Epidemiology & Infodemiology: Google Trends, YouTube, social platforms, and web-based health signals
2. Spatial & Spatiotemporal Analysis: County-level access, distance-based metrics, rural–urban disparities
3. Pharmacoepidemiology & Drug Safety: GLP-1s, polypharmacy networks, adverse event surveillance
4. AI & Machine Learning for Public Health: Predictive modeling, anomaly detection, network and hypergraph methods
5. Health Equity & Access Measurement: Naloxone access, pharmacy infrastructure, specialty care deserts

Methods & Tools:
A. Languages: Python, R, SQL, Stata
B. Core Libraries: pandas, numpy, geopandas, scikit-learn, statsmodels, PyTrends
C. Mapping & Visualization: folium, plotly, kepler.gl, matplotlib
D. Modeling: regression, APC models, time-series, network & hypergraph analytics.

What You’ll Find HerE?
a. Reproducible pipelines for digital health surveillance
b. Scripts for API data collection and cleaning
c. Spatial access and distance-based health equity metrics
d. Interactive HTML dashboards and maps
e. Methodological experiments linked to peer-reviewed research
f. Each repository is designed to be transparent, extensible, and policy-relevant.

Collaboration:
I collaborate with:
a. Academic researchers
b. Health systems and public health agencies
c. Data scientists working on applied health problems

If your work involves population-level inference, digital signals, or spatial health data, we’re likely aligned.
