Hi, I’m Akshaya, an Associate Professor of Epidemiology working at the intersection of population health, digital data, and applied AI.
My work focuses on turning messy, large-scale digital signals into policy-relevant public health evidence - with an emphasis on spatial access, health misinformation, pharmacoepidemiology, and real-world surveillance.
This GitHub hosts fully reproducible research code, methodological prototypes, and visualization tools used in academic publications, grant proposals, and public-facing dashboards.

Research Focus
1. Digital Epidemiology & Infodemiology: Google Trends, YouTube, social platforms, and web-based health signals
2. Spatial & Spatiotemporal Analysis: County-level access, distance-based metrics, rural–urban disparities
3. Pharmacoepidemiology & Drug Safety: GLP-1s, polypharmacy networks, adverse event surveillance
4. AI & Machine Learning for Public Health: Predictive modeling, anomaly detection, network and hypergraph methods
5. Health Equity & Access Measurement: Naloxone access, pharmacy infrastructure, specialty care deserts
