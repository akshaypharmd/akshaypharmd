Hi, I’m Akshaya, an Associate Professor of Epidemiology working at the intersection of population health, digital data, and applied AI.
My work focuses on turning messy, large-scale digital signals into policy-relevant public health evidence—with an emphasis on spatial access, health misinformation, pharmacoepidemiology, and real-world surveillance.
This GitHub hosts fully reproducible research code, methodological prototypes, and visualization tools used in academic publications, grant proposals, and public-facing dashboards.
